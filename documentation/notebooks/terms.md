## Quick Terminology

- <b>Unfiltered Water Level</b>: Water Level calculated using the Hydrostatic Method with no filter applied.
- <b>Storm-Tide (Low-pass Filtered) Water Level</b>: Water Level calculated using the Hydrostatic Method with a Low-pass 4th Order Butterworth Filter applied to 6 minute frequencies and higher.
- <b>Average Zero Up-crossing Period</b>: Second spectral moment statistic measuring the mean wave period on the sea surface (length of average wave period that crosses the mean sea surface).
- <b>Significant Wave Height</b>: Spectral moment statistic referring to the wave height of the top third highest waves 
- <b>Power Spectral Density</b>: Sea surface wave variance spectral density is the variance of wave amplitude within a range of wave frequency
- <b>Spectral Moment</b>: A parameter for spectral energy integration in order to generate wave statistics
